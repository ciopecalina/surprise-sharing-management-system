1. Initialization of Surprises:
Candies, FortuneCookie, and MinionToy surprises are created:
• Candies are initialized with the specified number and type.
• FortuneCookie is initialized with a message based on the index.
• MinionToy is initialized with a name based on the index.


2. Testing Each Bag Type (FIFO, LIFO, RANDOM):
For each type of bag, namely BagFIFO, BagLIFO, and BagRandom:
• The respective bag is created.
• Candies, MinionToy, and FortuneCookie surprises are added to the bag.
• The size of the bag is checked before and after each addition operation.
• One surprise is extracted from the bag, and the size is checked after each extraction.


3. Testing Surprise Distribution Methods (GiveSurpriseAndApplause, GiveSurpriseAndSing, GiveSurpriseAndHug):
For each distribution method and bag type combination:
• An object is created with the specified behavior and waiting time.
• Candies, MinionToy, and FortuneCookie surprises are added.
• All surprises are given at once using “giveAll”.
• The same object is reconstructed, and each surprise is given one at a time using “give”.

This scenario is tested for each of the following combinations:
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause - FIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause - LIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause - RANDOM
- GiveSurpriseAndSing - FIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndSing - LIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndSing - RANDOM
- GiveSurpriseAndHug - FIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndHug - LIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndHug - RANDOM


4. Testing Bag Fusion:
• Two bags of different types are created to test bag fusion, where the first bag contains all surprises.
• The size of both bags is displayed.
• Surprises are added to both bags.
• The size of both bags is displayed again.
• The contents of the second bag are transferred to the first bag.
• The size of both bags after the transfer is displayed.
• Surprises are extracted from the first bag until it is empty, and the size is checked after each extraction.

This scenario is tested for various combinations of bag types and surprise distribution methods to ensure comprehensive testing:
- BagFIFO + BagLIFO
- BagFIFO + BagRandom
- BagLIFO + BagFIFO
- BagLIFO + BagRandom
- BagRandom + BagFIFO 
- BagRandom + BagLIFO 

- GiveSurpriseAndApplause FIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause FIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause FIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause LIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause LIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause LIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause RANDOM + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause RANDOM + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndApplause RANDOM + BagRandom

- GiveSurpriseAndSing FIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndSing FIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndSing FIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndSing LIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndSing LIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndSing LIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndSing RANDOM + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndSing RANDOM + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndSing RANDOM + BagRandom

- GiveSurpriseAndHug FIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndHug FIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndHug FIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndHug LIFO + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndHug LIFO + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndHug LIFO + BagRandom
- GiveSurpriseAndHug RANDOM + BagFIFO 
- GiveSurpriseAndHug RANDOM + BagLIFO
- GiveSurpriseAndHug RANDOM + BagRandom
